            <p>
                A super-simplified version of a password manager with a unique solution that helps the user manage and carry their highly confidential data in a secure digital file.
                A tool to generate customized passwords with prefixes, postfixes, and industry-standard requirements (i.e. lowercase, uppercase, digits & special characters)
                An app that is built and generated for the intended user that works with your unique license key.

            <h2>Why should you use KBFob?</h2>
            <p>

            It simply solves the purpose of keeping your highly sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, bank PIN, payment info, and personal identity data) in a highly secure manner (AES 256 Encryption) on your local device (not-on-the-cloud).
A feature to restore your master password that is highly secured on KBFob Private Cloud(completely optional).
The KBF file can only be accessed using the KBFob App with a unique license that is generated for a specific user.
Example: Person-A & Person-B created their KBF File (e.g. personA.kbf and personB.kbf respectively) using the licensed KBFob App. Person-A cannot open/access personB.kbf using his/her licensed KBFob app and Person-B canâ€™t open/access personB.kbf using his/her licensed KBFob App.

            <p>
                Contact the KBFob Team to get your license and application for you.
                Once App is downloaded, launch the app and create your secure KBF file using the registration process. After successful registration, the KBF file will be created that contains your data (encrypted format).
                The KBF file can be accessed from multiple devices that run on Windows, Mac, and *NIX OS.
                With the given KBFob file/data template/format, the data can be imported in bulk to avoid data-entry.
                KBF files can be created for individuals, family members, or businesses.
                Simple search mechanism to look for a specific keyword in your KBF file records.
